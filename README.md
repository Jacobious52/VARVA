# VARVA
Visual After Run Variable Analysis

VARVA will allow developers to view and analyise debugging out generated by any programming that saves debuging infomation into a specified file format.

VARVA will use the Openframeworks library for drawing of graphs, etc and varibles over time. It will be primarily developed for OSX, however porting to Windows or Linux should be as easy as creating a empty project on the specified build platform with (Visual Studio or Code Blocks) and copying in the source code.

VARVA will include a trivial C++ Header and Python Module for use for debugging programs and algorithms.

Debug output format for library's

binary_working_dir/debug/*.var
Where binary_working_dir is the directory where your program binary to be debugged is located
Where *.var file are files that contain the debig output from your program for each variable.

The format for *.var is in a csv format:

<value>,<time>,<file>,<function>,<line>
